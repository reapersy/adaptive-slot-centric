def adjusted_rand_index(true_mask, pred_mask, name='ari_score'):
    r"""Computes the adjusted Rand index (ARI), a clustering similarity score.
    This implementation ignores points with no cluster label in `true_mask` (i.e.
    those points for which `true_mask` is a zero vector). In the context of
    segmentation, that means this function can ignore points in an image
    corresponding to the background (i.e. not to an object).
    Args:
    true_mask: `Tensor` of shape [batch_size, n_points, n_true_groups].
      The true cluster assignment encoded as one-hot.
    pred_mask: `Tensor` of shape [batch_size, n_points, n_pred_groups].
